**1 Corinthians 13:4-8 (NIV) -** `4` Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. `5` It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. `6` Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. `7` It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. `8` Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
